## About

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate and a Graduate fellow in the Bioinformatics and Systems Biology program at the University of Delaware. I have learned and even mastered many datamining and machine learning tools, allowing me to handle next-generation sequencing (NGS) data of increasing size and complexity, bordering on ‘big data’. I have also developed machine learning based approaches to handle NGS data in my lab. I am proficient in relational database development, design, maintenance for high-throughput data.
